Administrators can customize the web console using extensions, which let you run scripts and load custom stylesheets when the web console loads. Extension scripts allow you to override the default behavior of the web console and customize it for your needs.

For example, extension scripts can be used to add your own companyâ€™s branding or to add company-specific capabilities. A common use case for this is rebranding or white-labelling for different environments. You can use the same extension code, but provide settings that change the web console. You can change the look and feel of nearly any aspect of the user interface in this way.
